<p>What actually I used to make this project: <br>
=> React framework/library. <br>
=> React tailwind library for css <br>
=> Used Github to save code. <br>
=> express js for create server <br>
=> Deploy this site on firebase. <br>
=> Used firebase authentication for login register etc. <br>
</p>



<p>What Is the feature of this Project: <br>
This is actually photography site. Here you can buy premium photography packages and review the photo. <br>
=> Firstly  sets some data of some topics this site (we use loader to load data from server) <br>
=> I also create a separate server from the help of mongodb<br>
=> You can see package details and also add your comment according to the photo . <br>
=> Every course has different price . <br>
=> But When you want to comment you have to login otherwise you cannot comment<br>
